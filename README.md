# Tips & Tricks #Investigate with Microsoft Defender for Identity

---
Author: Daniel Pasquier

## Introduction

Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI) is the ideal solution for detecting and investigating advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions in Active Directory. For each AD Cybersecurity Crisis where our [Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/microsoft-detection-and-response-team-dart-blog-series/) is involved, they always ask for installing MDI to better investigate and set the appropriate remediation actions.
SecOp analysts and security professionals who use Microsoft Defender for Identity give us great feedbacks (such as preventing CryptoLocker activities etc..); and [Jugoslav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jugoslav-stevic-5693b773/) and [I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpasquier/) would like to share best practices from the field.
Keep in mind that MDI has unique capabilities to capture source data using deep packet inspection (traffic on all DCs), Event Tracing, Event Logs‚Ä¶ combined with User profiling, Machine learning and fast updated Alerts based on the Threat landscape.
  
MDI is also very relevant when the source attack comes from an unknown, unmanaged machine (no AV/EDR/GPO) where you have no control...

Here are the MDI capabilities :

In this documentation, we want to share some of useful Advanced Hunting KQL queries that you can use with the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender)  available from [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com).
  
To get the list of ActionType you can use in your environment for **IdentityDirectoryEvents** API, just run:

*IdentityDirectoryEvents*  
*| summarize by ActionType*
  
Here are few tips you can use or optimize:
  
## Tips 1 ‚Äì List of machines where service account is running

In case of a SVC account is compromised, or if you need to change the SVC account password or if someone knowing the SVC account password leaves your organisation; it could be very useful to know where a service account is configured (consider using gMSA instead):

*IdentityLogonEvents*  
*| where Application == @"Active Directory"*  
*| where AccountUpn == @"ACCOUNT_SVC@MSDEMO.FR" // set your SVC account here*  
*| where ActionType == @"LogonSuccess"*  
*| summarize count() by DeviceName*  
  
In this example, over the last 30 days, account_svc@msdemo.fr is used on 432 machines (logon success), the list of machines can be exported into a CSV file.
If needed, you can add additional information such as the LogonType (Resource access, Credentials validation‚Ä¶).
This is not an exhaustive list as the ActionType == LogonSuccess must occur in the last month, but after several months you should catch a good list.

## Tips 2 ‚Äì Kerberos versus NTLM use  

We all know that Kerberos provides several security benefits over NTLM and provides best performance. Here the following KQL query will provide the ratio of the success logon using NTLM and Kerberos:   

*IdentityLogonEvents*  
*| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess"*  
*| where Application == "Active Directory"*  
*| where Protocol in ("Ntlm", "Kerberos")*  
*| summarize count() by Protocol*  

![Image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95940022/146010249-f9ad5964-f8c0-4c4d-8b1d-d624e8663de7.png)  

Since the NTLMv1 hash is always at the same length, it is only a matter of seconds if an attacker wants to crack it. In addition, the challenge-response mechanism exposes the password to offline cracking. It is recommended not to use it if possible.  

To track the use of NTLMv1 you can run:  

*IdentityLogonEvents*  
*| where Timestamp > ago (7d) // shows activies in the last 7 days*  
*| where Application contains "directory"*  
*| where Protocol == "Ntlm"*  
*| extend AddData = todynamic(AdditionalFields)*  
*| extend NTLMV1 = tostring(AddData.IsNtlmV1)*  
*| extend Account = tostring((AddData).["ACTOR.ACCOUNT"])*  
*| where NTLMV1 == "True"*  
*| summarize count() by Account, AccountSid ,  DC = DestinationDeviceName*  

To understand failure reasons during Kerberos authentication in your environment:  

*IdentityLogonEvents*  
*| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"*  
*| where Application == "Active Directory"*  
*| where Protocol == "Kerberos"*  
*| summarize count() by FailureReason*  

![Image3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95940022/146011101-6fdebba2-09ac-446c-8158-8f6d21becb10.png)  

Do you want to know who and from where weak cipher such as DES or RC4 are used for Kerberos authentication? Just use the following query:  

*IdentityLogonEvents*   
*| where Protocol == @"Kerberos"*  
*| extend ParsedFields=parse_json(AdditionalFields)*  
*| project Timestamp, ActionType, DeviceName, IPAddress, DestinationDeviceName, AccountName, AccountDomain, EncryptionType = tostring(ParsedFields.EncryptionType)*  
*| where EncryptionType == @"Rc4Hmac"*

Remark : This information is also available from the [Microsoft Defender for Identity's identity security posture assessments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/isp-overview#access--using-cloud-app-security)

## Tips 3 ‚Äì List of files copied from a client to DCs over the last 30 days  

Except if your DCs are used as files server, which is of course not recommended at all you should not see many files copied from a workstation or member server to DCs.  

Using this KQL query you can monitor this activity and identify potential suspect activities or even risky activities:  

*IdentityDirectoryEvents*  
*| where ActionType == @"SMB file copy"*  
*| extend ParsedFields=parse_json(AdditionalFields)*  
*| project Timestamp, ActionType, DeviceName, IPAddress, AccountDisplayName, DestinationDeviceName, DestinationPort, FileName=tostring(ParsedFields.FileName), FilePath=tostring(ParsedFields.FilePath), Method=tostring(ParsedFields.Method)*  
*| where Method == @"Write"*  

![Image4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95940022/146016380-1d6dcb4a-02f7-4b2c-8fe0-70f21e197075.png) 

Remark: MDI has also an alert for data exfiltration (such as the NTDS.DIT file copied from a DC to a workstation).  

## Tips 4 ‚Äì ‚ÄúAccount Password Not Required‚Äù changed from FALSE to TRUE   

Even with a password policy in place that affects all user accounts, it is possible to set a blank password for a user with the setting ‚ÄúAccount Password Not Required‚Äù using for example a PowerShell cmdlet (not possible through the GUI). This is why it's important to list all users with this setting enabled using the MDI portal but also to track all changes from ‚ÄúAccount Password Not Required‚Äù = FALSE to TRUE:  

*IdentityDirectoryEvents*  
*| where ActionType == @"Account Password Not Required changed"*  
*| extend PreviousValue = todynamic(AdditionalFields)["FROM Account Password Not Required"]*  
*| extend NewValue = todynamic(AdditionalFields)["TO Account Password Not Required"]*  
*| where "True"==NewValue*  
*| project Timestamp, ActionType, Application, TargetAccountDisplayName, PreviousValue, NewValue*  

![Image5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95940022/146022121-bc2576a4-804d-4339-ae57-6848d56c7505.png)  

## Tips 5 ‚Äì ‚ÄúAccount Password Never Expires‚Äù changed from FALSE to TRUE  

This setting could be expected for service account if you can‚Äôt use gMSA; however, we should never see ‚ÄúAccount Password Never Expires‚Äù changed from FALSE to TRUE for an user account (not SVC) or for an admin account (a lazy one üòä). Here how to track this information:  

*IdentityDirectoryEvents*  
*| where ActionType == @"Account Password Never Expires changed"*  
*| extend PreviousValue = todynamic(AdditionalFields)["FROM Account Password Never Expires"]*  
*| extend NewValue = todynamic(AdditionalFields)["TO Account Password Never Expires"]*  
*| where "True"==NewValue*  
*| project Timestamp, ActionType, Application, TargetAccountDisplayName, PreviousValue, NewValue*

## Tips 6 ‚Äì Expected ‚ÄúPowerShell execution‚Äù on DCs?  

MDI generates an alert when remote code execution is performed against a DC, however if you need further investigation, you can run the following query to get the list of PowerShell command executed remotely to a DC (Of course it‚Äôs the same logic for ‚ÄúWMI execution‚Äù, PSEXE execution‚Ä¶):  

*IdentityDirectoryEvents*  
*| where ActionType == @"PowerShell execution"*  
*| extend Command = todynamic(AdditionalFields)["PowerShell execution"]*  
*| project Timestamp, ActionType, DeviceName, IPAddress, DestinationDeviceName, AccountName, AccountDomain, Command*  

![Image7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95940022/146022984-a1cb5191-e3e7-4b28-88fa-edb0ce37bde0.png)  

## Tips 7 ‚Äì Expected ‚ÄúService creation‚Äù on DCs?  

Do you want to know which new service, task scheduled are created on yours DCs remotely? Here is a sample for all services except for two which are expected in my environment:  

*IdentityDirectoryEvents*  
*| where ActionType == @"Service creation"*  
*| extend ParsedFields=parse_json(AdditionalFields)*  
*| project Timestamp, ActionType, TargetDeviceName, AccountName, AccountDomain, ServiceName=tostring(ParsedFields.ServiceName), ServiceCommand=tostring(ParsedFields.ServiceCommand)*  
*| where ServiceName != @"Microsoft Monitoring Agent Azure VM Extension Heartbeat Service"*  
*| where ServiceName != @"MOMAgentInstaller"*  

![Image8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95940022/146023422-f8fcefb3-97a4-4e17-ac25-04fc668f3806.png)  

## Tips 8 ‚Äì Total Count ‚Äì Computers with failed logon unknown users (>100)  

This query provides information mainly for misconfigured application that generate failed logon with status ‚ÄúUnknownUser‚Äù, probably because the wrong name was set.  

Of course, it could be also an attacker looking for valid account name based on the DC response WrongPassword (0xc000006a) or NoSuchUser (0xc0000064):  

*IdentityLogonEvents*  
*| where LogonType == "Failed logon"*  
*| where FailureReason == "UnknownUser"*  
*| where isnotempty(TargetDeviceName)*  
*| summarize Attempts = count() by DeviceName, TargetDeviceName , FailureReason*  
*| where Attempts > 100*

## Tips 9 ‚Äì Top Spike for user‚Äôs logon activities over the last 30 days  

If you see a logon spike activity based on the activity during the past 30 days it could worth an investigation üòä :  

*let interval = 12h;*  
*IdentityLogonEvents*  
*| where isnotempty(AccountUpn)*  
*| make-series LogonCount = count() on Timestamp from ago(30d) to now() step interval by AccountUpn*  
*| extend (flag, score, baseline) = series_decompose_anomalies(LogonCount)*  
*| mv-expand with_itemindex = FlagIndex flag to typeof(int) // Expand, but this time include the index in the array as FlagIndex*  
*| where flag == 1 // Once again, filter only to spikes*  
*| extend SpikeScore = todouble(score[FlagIndex]) // This will get the specific score associated with the detected spike*  
*| summarize MaxScore = max(SpikeScore) by AccountUpn*  
*| top 5 by MaxScore desc*  
*| join kind=rightsemi IdentityLogonEvents on AccountUpn*  
*| summarize count() by AccountUpn, bin(Timestamp, interval)*  
*| render timechart*

## Tips 10 ‚Äì Processes that performed LDAP authentication with cleartext passwords  

This query is available from  [https://github.com/Iveco/xknow_infosec/blob/main/M365D_tables.md](https://github.com/Iveco/xknow_infosec/blob/main/M365D_tables.md) and requires to have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) to combine the result with MDI detection :  

*IdentityLogonEvents*  
*| where Timestamp > ago(7d)*   
*| where LogonType == "LDAP cleartext" //and isnotempty(AccountName)*  
*| project LogonTime = Timestamp, DeviceName, Application, ActionType, LogonType //,AccountName*  
*| join kind=inner (   
*DeviceNetworkEvents*  
*| where Timestamp > ago(7d) | where ActionType == "ConnectionSuccess"*  
*| extend DeviceName = toupper(trim(@"\..*$",DeviceName))*  
*| where RemotePort == "389"*  
*| project NetworkConnectionTime = Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName = InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine ) on DeviceName*  
*| where LogonTime - NetworkConnectionTime between (-2m .. 2m)*  
*| project Application, LogonType, ActionType, LogonTime, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine //, AccountName*  

## Tips 11 ‚Äì Detect T0 Admin login on unsecure machines  

We all know that T0 Admins should be used only on secured/protected access workstations (SAW/PAW) to mitigate credential theft and a GPO can be used to deny logon types on all machines except a whitelist that matches SAW or PAW machines. However, you can query for ‚ÄúPotential lateral movement path identified‚Äù and exclude the machines they should only be logging in from assuming when the sensitive account logged on it would create a LMP. So let‚Äôs say you have a Tier0 machine that the admins should be logon from you can create a query like this:  

*let T0Machine = "adminpc.contoso.azure ";*  
*IdentityDirectoryEvents*  
*| where ActionType == "Potential lateral movement path identified"*  
*| where AccountUpn == @"AdminT0@msdemo.fr"*  
*| where DeviceName <> T0Machine*  

## Tips 12 ‚Äì Create a detection / notification rule  

Depending on the columns result you can set a detection rule to run at regular intervals, generating alerts and taking response actions whenever there are matches; this could be useful to notify your SOC team.
